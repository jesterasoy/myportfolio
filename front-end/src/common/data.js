      'A recipe website that allows users to search for recipes, view details, and save their favorites.',
    Description:
      "Plated is a recipe blog I built using PHP, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS and JavaScript, designed to make discovering and cooking new meals simple and enjoyable. The site connects with TheMealDB API to provide users with a wide range of recipes — complete with ingredients, cooking instructions, and meal images. Visitors can browse through categories, explore international dishes, and even search for specific meals based on their cravings.\n\nWith a focus on clean design and a user-friendly interface, Plated ensures a smooth experience whether you're exploring from a desktop or a mobile device. Every feature — from the dynamic content loading to the responsive layout — is carefully crafted to make the process of finding and following recipes as easy as possible.\n\nThis project showcases my ability to work with APIs and build interactive, content-driven web applications from scratch using core web technologies. Plated reflects both my passion for web development and my goal to create useful, engaging online experiences.",
