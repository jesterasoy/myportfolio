I am writing to express my interest as Front-End Web Developer position. As a 
recent graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Global Reciprocal Colleges,
I have an eagerness to bring my passion for clean and user-friendly interfaces using my expertise
in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and React.

During my academic journey, I did some web development projects, including our Capstone Project.
It is a library booking system using ReactJs and TailwindCSS. In addition, I gained hands-on
experience as a freelance web developer, where I used PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build 
responsive website for client. These experiences taught me a lot on how to collaborate with clients and
solving problems to deliver a solutions.

I'm passionate about creating web applications, and I'm always excited to learn new emerging technologies
that will enhance and improve my knowledge. I will be so much honored to work and grow on your team and contribute
to building products.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how can I contribute a lot on the team.

Sincerely,
Jester Nicholas C. Asoy
